This projects holds the contents for my personal website, hosted at <https://raulpe7eira.tech>.

It's automatically transformed by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "link to Jekyll website") into a static site, and uses the [jekyll-polyglot](https://polyglot.untra.io/ "link to polyglot website") for the i18n support.

The theme build was based on the [jekyll-uno](https://github.com/joshgerdes/jekyll-uno "link to source of the jekyll-one theme").

## How to use?

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload

# to deploy
JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build
```
