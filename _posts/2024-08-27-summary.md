I'm a software developer with +20 years of <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/raulpe7eira" title="link to LinkedIn profile" target="_blank">professional experience</a>, currently providing solutions with <a href="https://elixir-lang.org" title="link to Elixir website">Elixir</a>, but I've worked a lot with <a href="https://kotlinlang.org" title="link to Kotlin website">Kotlin</a>, <a href="https://java.com" title="link to Java website">Java</a>, and <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262" title="link to JavaScript specification">JavaScript</a> previously.

All my professional experience is based on my graduation in 2001 at the extinct UniverCidade and postgraduate courses of *"Analysis, Design and Management Systems"* and *"Ergonomics, Usability and HCI: Ergodesign and Interfaces Assessment"* at <a href="http://www.puc-rio.br" title="lint to PUC-Rio website" target="_blank">PUC-Rio</a>.

One of the best parts of my profession is that you are continually specializing and seeking ways to improve and break challenges in various areas of human knowledge, this means that I'm always in a process of reconstruction.

When I'm not working, you can find me taking care of my family, <a href="https://strava.com/athletes/raulpe7eira" title="link to Strava profile" target="_blank">cycling</a>, <a href="https://imdb.com/user/ur28106453" title="link to IMDb profile" target="_blank">watching a movie</a>, <a href="https://last.fm/user/raulpereira" title="link to last.fm profile" target="_blank">listening to rock</a> or podcast, reading a comic book or a book, be it technology or just a children's book for my little babies.

I also <a href="https://github.com/raulpe7eira" title="link to GitHub profile" target="_blank">push code</a> quite often, and <a href="https://instagram.com/raulpe7eira" title="link to Instagram profile" target="_blank">show off pictures</a> from time to time.
